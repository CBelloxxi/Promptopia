Still To Do:
- Implement Search
- Implement Click on tag
- Implement View other profiles
- Add favicon to the root/app

** Hint for Search and Click on Tag ** {

  [] Implement Search
    - Search by prompt
    - Search by tag
    - Search by username
  [] Implement Click on tag

   1. Code for this will have to be implemented within the Feed Component, add some search states, searchText, searchTimeout, searchResults.
   2. Then will need to filter results by those queries, handling Regex.
   3. Then will need to handleSearchChange and the function for the handleTagClick.

}

** Hint for View other Profiles ** {

  [] Implement View other profiles

  1. Will need to create a new folder or file within the profile directory.
  2. Very similar to the old profile page created BUT it will fetch posts from a different user.
  3. It will also need to reuse my existing profile component.

}
